In accordance with 07 24 00 <Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)>, L-shaped insulation boards must be utilized at the corners of all openings to mitigate the risk of stress cracking. Contractor is responsible for ensuring L-shaped boards are used at all four corners of every window/door opening and that no vertical or horizontal insulation joints align with the corners of the openings.\n*   **Base Coat and Reinforcing Mesh:** Reviewed the application of the cementitious base coat and reinforcing mesh. Per 07 24 00 <Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)>, the reinforcing mesh must be fully embedded within the base coat such that the mesh pattern is not visible. All mesh joints must maintain a minimum overlap of 65 mm (2.5 inches), and diagonal \"butterfly\" strips of mesh (approximately 200 mm x 300 mm) should be installed at all opening corners at a 45-degree angle to provide additional reinforcement against cracking.\n*   **Drying and Curing:** Contractor is reminded that the base coat must be allowed to dry/cure for a minimum of 24 hours (or longer if required by ambient conditions) prior to the application of the finish coat, in accordance with 07 24 00 <Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)> and manufacturer instructions.\n*   **Sealant Interface:** In accordance with 01 11 50 <Scope of Work> and 07 24 00 <Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)>, sealant must be applied only to the base coat (or a color-primed base coat). Sealant must NOT be applied over the EIFS finish coat, as this significantly reduces adhesion and increases the risk of premature failure.\n*   **Horizontal Terminations:** All horizontal EIFS terminations, including window sills and decorative mouldings, must be provided with an outward slope to facilitate positive drainage, except where metal drip flashings are provided, as per 01 11 50 <Scope of Work>.\n\n### Division 08 - Openings:\n\n*   **Window Perimeter Integration:** The interface between the EIFS and window frames must be maintained with a minimum sealant joint width of 13 mm (0.5 inch) to allow for thermal expansion and contraction, as per the 07 24 00 <Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)> specification. Contractor to ensure backer rods are sized 25% larger than the joint width to ensure proper compression and sealant profile.",

I have cited the 07 24 00 EIFS specification and the 01 11 50 Scope of Work found in the internal knowledge search. I have addressed L-shaped boards, mesh embedding, drying times, and sealant application protocols. Since no specific photos with UUIDs were assigned, I am using standard paragraphs as per the formatting instructions."

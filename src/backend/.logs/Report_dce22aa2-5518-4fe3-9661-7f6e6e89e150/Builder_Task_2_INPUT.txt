[MESSAGE 1] Role: SYSTEM --------------------------------


    You are an expert Third-Party Construction Reviewer acting on behalf of Pretium. Your role is to perform a "General Review" to identify if installed work conforms to project specifications, applicable building codes, and manufacturer requirements.

### CORE OBJECTIVES
1.  **Verify Compliance:** Determine if work aligns with the specific contract documents and trade standards.
2.  **Risk Management:** Document findings accurately to limit liability. Avoid language that implies a guarantee of work you did not witness.
3.  **Site Documentation:** Record weather, crew size, and specific locations of work to establish the context of the inspection.

### LIABILITY GUARDRAILS (STRICT ADHERENCE)
* **No Blanket Approvals:** NEVER imply general acceptance of work.
    * *Bad:* "The roofing is installed correctly."
    * *Good:* "No deficiencies were observed in the specific [Location/Gridline] area reviewed."
* **Location Specificity:** You must describe the EXACT location of inspected work. This limits liability to that specific area and prevents assuming responsibility for the rest of the site.
* **The "Not Observed" Clause:** If a critical specification item was not visible (covered up or not started), you must state:
    * *"Condition not observed/verified at this time. Contractor reminded to conform to Specification [Ref]."*
* **Unforeseen Conditions:** If you encounter conditions not in the original design, document them and suggest a course of action or note that the Consultant must be contacted.

### REPORTING PROTOCOLS
1.  **Deficiency Focus:** Your primary value is identifying deviations. Report on:
    * Workmanship failing to meet trade standards.
    * Material non-compliance.
    * Safety hazards (Flag as CRITICAL immediately).
2.  **Site Interactions:** If the data implies a conversation took place, document it to share risk.
    * *Phrasing:* "Reviewed [Issue] with the Site Superintendent; agreed that [Action] would be taken."
3.  **Positive Observations:** Keep them brief and specific. Do not let a positive observation imply the *entire* project is up to that standard.
4.  **Standards of Reference:** When flagging issues, implicitly reference:
    * Project Specifications (primary).
    * Manufacturer's Minimum Requirements (e.g., for roofing, glazing).
    * Industry Best Practices (e.g., CSA for concrete, masonry guidelines).

### TONE & STYLE
* **Independent & Objective:** You are a third-party specialist. You do not issue "commands" to the contractor; you record "deficiencies" and "required actions" based on the contract.
* **Professional:** Use active voice. Be concise.

### MISSING INFORMATION PROTOCOL
You are generating a draft for a Human Professional Engineer. Do NOT guess specific details if they are not found in the context.
* **If critical data (Location, Weather, Specific Spec Number) is missing:** You MUST insert a placeholder in this format: `**[MISSING: <Data Type>]**`.
    * *Example:* "Observed water ponding at **[MISSING: Specific Gridline/Location]**."
    * *Example:* "Weather conditions: **[MISSING: Weather Data]**."
* **Reasoning:** It is better to highlight a gap for the human reviewer than to write a vague or incorrect statement.

**CRITICAL SEARCH RULE:** Your search queries MUST be strictly limited to pure technical keywords (e.g., "EIFS window flashing details"). Exclude all specific identifiers, Report IDs, or conversational filler from your query string.

    ---
    STRICT FORMATTING PROTOCOLS:
    Follow this structure strictly.

1. **# GENERAL** (ID: general)
   * Summarize key deficiencies or critical findings first. Do not re-list all findings.
   * Briefly mention progress relative to schedule.
   * **Constraint:** No images in this section.

2. **# SITE / STAGING AREA** (ID: site-conditions)
   * **Required Fields:**
       * **Weather Conditions:** [Value OR "**[MISSING: Check Site Logs]**"]
       * **Crew Size / Active Trades:** [Value OR "**[MISSING: Verify Trades Present]**"]
       * **Work Area (CRITICAL):** [Specific Location/Gridlines OR "**[MISSING: Specific Floor/Elevation/Gridline]**"]
         * *Note: This limits liability to the inspected area only.*

3. **# OBSERVATIONS** (ID: observations)
   * Group findings by Trade (e.g., "## Division 07 - Roofing:"). (It is your job to determine the best logical structure for the report):
   * **Strategy:** Maintain strict third-party objectivity. Document observations without assuming responsibility for the contractor's means, methods, or overall work quality. The Contractor retains sole responsibility for execution and compliance. Focus on deviations from spec. Do not guarantee, certify, or approve work. Frame all statements to reflect that the Contractor is strictly liable for construction execution and code compliance. ALWAYS site references in the specification.
   * **Image Table Format (STRICT):**
       * Do NOT use list syntax (bullets) inside table cells.
       * Use `<br>` for line breaks.
       * Columns must be: |  |  | (no names)
       * Example:
         | | |
         | :--- | :--- |
         | The pre-finished sill flashing profile observed at the East elevation appears to be in general conformance; Contractor remains responsible for ensuring the ongoing installation aligns strictly with 07 62 00 <Sheet Metal Flashing and Trim>.<br>Observed insufficient end-dam height at the flashing terminations. Contractor to review this deviation and rectify the condition to ensure watertightness in accordance with 07 62 00 <Sheet Metal Flashing and Trim>.| ![Flashing Detail](IMG_ID_123) |

4. **# DEFICIENCY SUMMARY** (ID: deficiency-summary)
   * **Constraint:** Do not design new solutions. Direct the contractor back to the Contract Documents.
   * **Logic:**
       * If **Critical/Safety Issue**: Make it clear it is urgent.
       * If **Defect**: Write "Contractor to rectify [Issue] in accordance with Specification [Ref]."
       * If **Unforeseen Condition**: Write "Contractor to submit RFI (Request for Information)

**************************************************************************
NOTE: This guide specification covers the 
requirements for barrier-type and drainable exterior 
insulation and finish systems (EIFS), Classes PB and 
PM, which may be applied to concrete or brick 
masonry, or to wood or metal frame construction. 
EIFS are exterior finish systems that include an 
integral layer of thermal insulation.
Adhere to UFC 1-300-02 Unified Facilities Guide 
Specifications (UFGS) Format Standard when editing 
this guide specification or preparing new project 
specification sections. Edit this guide 
specification for project specific requirements by 
adding, deleting, or revising text. For bracketed 
items, choose applicable item(s) or insert 
appropriate information.
Remove information and requirements not required in 
respective project, whether or not brackets are 
present.
Comments, suggestions and recommended changes for 
this guide specification are welcome and should be 
submitted as a Criteria Change Request (CCR).
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Do not specify EIFS for areas below grade or 
in areas subject to abuse by moving vehicles or 
equipment, such as a loading dock. Avoid the use of 
EIFS in expected heavy pedestrian traffic areas. If 
such use cannot be avoided, select an appropriate 
high-impact resistant system. Avoid exposure of 
EIFS to standing water or prolonged contact with 
snow. Do not specify EIFS for other than vertical 
surfaces, except narrow ledges and windowsills where 
the minimum slope is 25 mm in 50 mm one inch in 2 
inch. Flashing is required at parapet caps.
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 3
For EIFS directly applied over existing substrate 
(brick, concrete), specify preparation of substrate 
in this Section. For EIFS installed over new 
substrate, specify preparation of substrate under 
applicable section(s). Substrate must be sound, 
true, plumb, and within flatness tolerance of EIFS 
manufacturer, usually not more than 6 mm within 3000 
mm 1/4 inch within 10 feet. If existing substrate 
cannot be brought up to these requirements, a new 
substrate should be provided.
For EIFS installed over new sheathing board, provide 
sheathing in this Section. If sheathing is to be 
installed on metal furring or studs, provide furring 
or studs in Section 05 40 00 COLD-FORMED METAL 
FRAMING, specifying EIFS manufacturer's tolerance 
requirements.
In marine environments, light gage metal framing is 
subject to corrosion if water infiltrating through 
the EIFS is allowed to accumulate in runners. In 
project locations with Environmental Severity 
Classifications (ESC) C4 and C5, do not use metal 
framing for the support of the substrate or detail 
carefully to prevent water accumulation. Refer to 
UFC 1-200-01 for the ESC's of DoD installations.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: The coordination of work with other trades is 
important for the performance of the EIFS wall 
assembly, in particular the installation of flashing 
above windows and door heads, beneath window and 
door sills, at roof/wall intersections, decks, 
intersection of lower walls with higher ones, above 
projecting features, and at the base of the wall to 
ensure that where water is likely to penetrate the 
wall assembly, it will drain to the exterior at the 
source of the leak.
Design must meet the requirements of UFC 1-200-02, 
"High Performance and Sustainable Building 
Requirements" which invokes the requirements within 
UFC 3-101-01, "Architecture". UFC 1-200-02 and UFC 
3-101-01 make references throughout to ASHRAE 90.1 
and IgCC requirements governing energy efficiency 
and requirements for the components of building 
envelope design including moisture control and 
thermal performance.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: EIFS provides insulation and exterior finish 
for both new and renovated buildings. The systems 
are available in two classes: PB and PM. 
a. Class PB Systems are typically composed of a 2 
mm to 6 mm 1/16 inch to 1/4 inch cementitious or 
non-cementitious base coat, one or more layers of 
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 4
polymer-coated glass fiber mesh, and a 
non-cementitious finish coat. The Government 
requires EIFS systems to be Drainable systems. PB 
systems are most commonly used over molded expanded 
polystyrene (MEPS) insulation which is adhesively 
attached to the substrate. The non-cementitious 
base coat systems have good impact resistance but 
may be punctured by sharp objects. The MEPS 
insulation allows water vapor migration, which can 
either ventilate the system beneficially or allow 
moisture into the substrate. Class PB EIFS should 
not be used in first floor, high traffic areas, or 
in areas where pedestrians congregate. Where so 
used, they must have at least one layer of 567 g 20 
ounce reinforcing fabric mesh followed by one layer 
of minimum 113 g 4 ounce reinforcing mesh. Class PB 
systems are the least expensive and most widely used 
of the two classes.
b. Class PM Systems are typically composed of a 6 
mm to 9 mm 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch thick, rigid, 
polymer-modified cementitious base coat, a 
polymer-coated fiber mesh, and a cementitious finish 
coat. They are most commonly used over an extruded 
expanded-polystyrene (XEPS) insulation board which 
is mechanically attached to the substrate. Class PM 
systems have good puncture resistance, but are 
susceptible to damage from blunt impacts. The XEPS 
insulation allows less water vapor movement.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Drainable systems are available from most 
EIFS manufacturers. These drainable systems are 
either Class PB or Class PM systems that are 
designed to provide an avenue for flow and drainage 
of incidental moisture from the wall assembly.
Each manufacturer has taken a different design 
approach to achieve drainage of moisture from their 
systems. ASTM E2273, Standard Test Method for 
Determining the Drainage Efficiency of EIFS Clad 
Wall Assemblies has been published. Refer to the 
requirements of UFC 1-200-02 for further guidance on 
standards for moisture control of building envelopes 
and UFC 3-101-01, Architecture.

perimeter, and joints with other materials.
4. Joint layout on elevations. The designer must 
locate joint spacing and areas within the 
recommendations of at least three qualified EIFS 
manufacturers. Show all expansion joints at 
building expansion joints, where substrates change, 
and where significant structural movement occurs.
5. Include location of control joints on the 
drawings, which are required for Class PM EIFS to 
help prevent lamina cracking. Individual areas must 
not exceed 14 square meters 150 square feet, with a 
maximum dimension not exceeding 5500 mm 18 feet and 
a maximum length to height ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. 
(Control joints are not typically required for Class 
PB EIFS. Consult manufacturer for any specific 
requirements.)
6. Joint details, showing back wrapping, base coat, 
backer rod, and sealant.
7. Corner details, including drips at edges of 
soffits and at undersides of EIFS projections, and 
details of flashing and its relation to the EIFS and 
to other building elements and parts.
8. Thermal resistance value (R-Value) for each 
location.
9. If different levels of Impact Resistance are 
specified, indicate locations where each is required.
10. If different thicknesses of insulation board are 
to be used for architectural details, indicate the 
locations and thicknesses where required. Provide 
details which show that additional thicknesses are 
achieved by adding insulation board on top of the 
continuous underlaying insulation board.

1.2.1 System Requirements and Tests
**************************************************************************
NOTE: The overall performance requirements will 
vary with the design and geographic location of the 
building, as well as with occupation, type of 
construction, and other components specified. 
Include only those systems tests required for the 
particular building. Require full scale wall tests 
where prior tests on similar wall designs are not 
available or where the wall design differs 
significantly from the design tested. If testing 
for wind load, base the required pressure on wind 
speed specified in ICC IBC. Higher values may be 
used as required by applicable building code or 
based on local experience of wind forces at the 
site. Conduct tests both for positive and negative 
pressure.
Design must meet the requirements of UFC 3-101-01 
Architecture. UFC 3-101-01 provides references to 
ASHRAE 90.1 and IgCC regarding energy efficiency and 
thermal properties related to the building envelope 
design including moisture control and thermal 
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 9
performance.
**************************************************************************
The system must meet the performance requirements as verified by the tests 
listed below. Where a wall system of similar type, size, and design as 
specified for this project has been previously tested under the condition 
specified herein, the resulting test reports may be submitted in lieu of 
job specific tests.
1.2.1.1 Water Penetration
Test the system for water penetration by uniform static air pressure in 
accordance with ASTM E331. There must be no penetration of water beyond 
the plane of the base coat/EPS board interface after 15 minutes at 300 Pa
6.4 psf, or 20 percent of positive design wind pressure, whichever is 
greater.
1.2.1.2 Wind Load Test
Test the system for wind load by uniform static air pressure in accordance 
with ASTM E330/E330M (procedure A) to a minimum pressure of [_____] Pa
[_____] psf. There must be no permanent deformation, delamination, or

d. No significant lateral spread of flame from compartment of fire origin 
to adjacent spaces.
[1.2.1.4 Mock-Up Installation of EIFS
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Specify mock-up installation only if required 
because of significance and prominence of project. 
A mock-up installation may also be justified where 
out of the ordinary finishes or other special 
features are specified. The sample installation 
should be at least one story in height and one bay 
wide.
**************************************************************************
Complete wall mock-up installation [_____] mm [_____] ft high by [_____] mm
 [_____] ft wide, including typical control joints [and at least one 
window opening]. Control joints to be filled with sealant of type, 
manufacturer, and color selected. Construct mock-up installation at 
[manufacturer's plant] [job site]. Build mock-up to comply with the 
following requirements, using materials indicated for the completed work:
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 10
a. Locate mock-up installation(s) in the location and size [indicated] 
[as directed by the Contracting Officer].
b. Demonstrate the proposed range of color, texture, thickness, 
insulation, and workmanship.
c. Obtain Contracting Officer's written approval of mock-up before 
starting fabrication of work.
d. Maintain mock-up installation(s) during construction as a standard for 
judging the completed work by protecting them from weather and 
construction activities.
[ e. When directed, demolish and remove mock-up from the site.
]]1.2.2 Component Requirements and Tests
The components of the system must meet the performance requirements as 
verified by the tests listed below.
1.2.2.1 Surface Burning Characteristics
Conduct ASTM E84 test on samples consisting of base coat, reinforcing 
fabric, and finish coat. Cure for 28 days. The flame spread index must 
be 25 or less and the smoke developed index must be 450 or less.
1.2.2.2 Radiant Heat
The system must be tested in accordance with NFPA 268 on both the minimum 
and maximum thickness of insulation intended for use with no ignition 
during the 20-minute period.
1.2.2.3 Impact Resistance
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Select impact resistance for Class PB EIFS 
based on exposure of wall to potential impact 
hazard. Higher impact resistance may be limited to 
lower portion (e.g. on first floor only) of wall:
Standard impact 
resistance:
3 to 6 J 25 to 49 inch-lbs
Medium impact 
resistance:
6 to 10 J 50 to 89 inch-lbs
High impact 
resistance:
10 to 17 J 90 to 150 inch-lbs
Ultra high impact 
resistance:
Over 17 J Over 150 inch-lbs
Select lowest impact resistance for wall areas not 
accessible to public, (e.g., tower structures, air 
shafts). Select medium impact resistance for areas 
with limited access to public. Select high impact 
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 11
resistance for areas with general access to public, 
(e.g., first floor walls). Select ultra high impact 
resistance in locations with constant access.
The thickness and hardness of Class PM EIFS lamina 
make these systems inherently more resistant than 
Class PB EIFS to impact failures (defined as 
penetration of the lamina) from a small or pointed 
object, as simulated by the probe-type indenture 
used in the EIMA test method 101.86. Class PM EIFS 
are more prone to impact failures (cracking or 
crushing of lamina) from heavy, blunt objects. ASTM 
E695 is a test method designed to test the whole 
wall assembly (including the substrate structural 
supports) and not specifically the impact resistance 
of Class PM EIFS. However, until a test method to 
measure the impact resistance for Class PM EIFS is 
developed, if ever, ASTM E695 provides some means of 
qualifying minimum performance for impact resistance 
of Class PM EIFS.
For Class PB EIFS, use paragraph a. Class PB Systems 
and delete paragraph b. Impact Mass. For Class PM 
EIFS, use paragraph b. Impact Mass and delete 
paragraph a. Class PB Systems. If selection of 
class is Contractor's option, retain both paragraphs 
and edit accordingly.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: If two or more impact resistance requirements 
are provided, repeat requirement. Indicate on the 
drawings where each requirement applies.
**************************************************************************
a. Class PB Systems: Hemispherical Head Test; 28 day cured specimen of 
PB EIFS in accordance with ASTM E2486/E2486M. The test specimen must 
exhibit no broken reinforcing fabric in accordance with 
ASTM E2486/E2486M at an impact of [_____] J [_____] in-lb.
b. Impact Mass: Test 28 day cured specimen of PM EIFS in accordance with 
ASTM E695. The test specimen must exhibit no cracking or denting 
after twelve impacts by 13.6 kg 30 lbs lead shot mass from 150 to 1800 
mm 6 in to 6 ft drop heights in 150 mm 6 in intervals.
1.2.3 Sub-Component Requirements and Tests
Unless otherwise stated, the test specimen must consist of reinforcing 
mesh, base coat, and finish coat applied in accordance with manufacturer's 
printed recommendations to the insulation board to be used on the 
building. For mildew resistance, only the finish coat is applied onto 
glass slides for testing. The specimen must be suitably sized for the 
apparatus used and be allowed to cure for a minimum of 28 days prior to 
testing.
1.2.3.1 Abrasion Resistance
Test in accordance with ASTM D968, Method A. Test a minimum of two

must exhibit no visible cracking, flaking, peeling, blistering, yellowing, 
fading, or other such deterioration.
1.2.3.3 Mildew Resistance
Test in accordance with ASTM D3273. The specimen must consist of the 
finish coat material, applied to clean 75 mm by 100 mm 3 inch by 4 inch
glass slides and must be allowed to cure for 28 days. After 28 days of 
exposure, the specimen must not show any growth.
1.2.3.4 Salt Spray Resistance
Test in accordance with ASTM B117. The specimen must be a minimum of 100 
mm by 150 mm 4 inch by 6 inch and must be tested for a minimum of 300 
hours. After exposure, the specimen must exhibit no observable 
deterioration, such as chalking, fading, or rust staining.
1.2.3.5 Water Resistance
Test in accordance with ASTM D2247. The specimen must be a minimum of 100 
mm by 150 mm 4 inch by 6 inch. After 14 days, the specimen must exhibit 
no cracking, checking, crazing, erosion, blistering, peeling, or 
delamination.
1.2.3.6 Absorption-Freeze-Thaw
Class PB systems must be tested in accordance with ASTM E2570/E2570M for 
60 cycles of freezing and thawing. After testing, the specimen must 
exhibit no cracking, checking, or splitting, and negligible weight gain. 
Class PM systems must be tested in accordance with ASTM C67/C67M for 50 
cycles of freezing and thawing. After testing, the specimens must exhibit 
no cracking or checking and have negligible weight gain.
1.2.3.7 Sample Boards
Unless otherwise stated, provide sample EIFS Component 300 by 600 mm 12 by 
24 inches, on sheathing board, including finish color and texture, typical 
joints and sealant. If more than one color, finish, or pattern is used, 
provide one sample for each. The test specimen must consist of 
reinforcing mesh, base coat, and finish coat applied in accordance with 
manufacturer's printed recommendations to the insulation board to be used 
on the building.
1.2.4 Moisture Analysis
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Condensation of water vapor within the system 
or wall assembly can lead to performance problems. 
Condensation can cause leaks in the wall leading to 
damage to the wall structure such as rotting of wood 
studs, corrosion of metal framing, mold, staining 
and discoloration of interior finishes. Moisture, 
if trapped in EIFS, expands upon freezing, and it 
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 13
can damage the EIFS coatings. Should analysis 
determine that the project design is potentially 
subject to condensation or mold problems, the 
installation of a vapor retarder, changing the 
insulation thickness, or selecting a different 
insulation material may be required.
Design to meet the requirements of UFC 1-200-02, 
High Performance and Sustainable Building 
Requirements, and UFC 3-101-01, Architecture.
For additional guidance see ASHRAE Handbook of 
Fundamentals, Chapters 25-27 Heat, Air and Moisture 
Control in Building Assemblies - Fundamentals, and 
ASTM C755, Standard Practice for Selection of Water 
Vapor Retarders for Thermal Insulation. The 
computer program MOIST is a user-friendly tool based 
on hourly weather data that provides information on 
moisture content of building materials, the duration 
of high moisture content excursions, and on surface 
relative humidity.
The designer should consult with the system 
manufacturer when evaluating EIFS for condensation 
potential. Manufacturers typically offer water 
vapor transmission analysis services at no cost to 
designers and Contractors.
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
NOTE: The following analysis ensures the system 
performance if the Contractor's selected systems 
differ from the design.
**************************************************************************
Perform a job specific vapor transmission analysis based on project 
specific climate and specified wall components and materials. Indicate 
the temperatures and relative humidities for the inside and outside of the 
building; a complete listing of the building components, their thickness, 
thermal resistance and permeance, as well as building location and use. 
If a mathematical model was used for the analysis, include the name of the 
model and the supplier/developer.
1.3 SUBMITTALS

PART 3 EXECUTION
3.1 EXAMINATION
Examine substrate and existing conditions to determine that the EIFS can 
be installed as required by the EIFS manufacturer and that all work 
related to the EIFS is properly coordinated. Surface must be sound and 
free of oil, loose materials or protrusions which will interfere with the 
system installation. If deficiencies are found, notify the Contracting 
Officer and do not proceed with installation until the deficiencies are 
corrected. The substrate must be plane, with no deviation greater than 6 mm
 1/4 inch when tested with a 3 m 10 foot straightedge. Determine 
flatness, plumbness, and any other conditions for conformance to 
manufacturer's instructions.
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 22
3.2 SURFACE PREPARATION
**************************************************************************
NOTE: The paragraph below only specifies flatness 
of substrate to the EIFS manufacturer's 
requirements. Where, because of the prominence of 
the building, more stringent flatness requirements 
are necessary, these should be added to the 
paragraph.
**************************************************************************
Prepare existing surfaces for application of the EIFS to meet flatness 
tolerances and surface preparation according to manufacturer's 
installation instructions [but provide a flatness of not more than [6] 
[_____] mm in 3000 mm [1/4] [_____] inch in 10 feet]. Provide clean 
surfaces free of oil and loose material without protrusions adversely 
affecting the installation of the insulation board. For adhesively 
attached EIFS, existing deteriorated paint must be removed. Due to 
substrate conditions or as recommended by the system manufacturer, a 
primer may be required. Apply the primer to existing surfaces as 
recommended by the manufacturer. Use masking tape to protect areas 
adjacent to the EIFS to prevent base or finish coat to be applied to areas 
not intended to be covered with the EIFS. The Contractor must not proceed 
with the installation until all noted deficiencies of the substrate are 
corrected.
3.3 INSTALLATION
Install EIFS as indicated, comply with manufacturer's instructions except 
as otherwise specified, and in accordance with the shop drawings. Submit 
manufacturer's standard printed instructions for the installation of the 
EIFS; include requirements for condition and preparation of substrate, 
installation of EIFS, and requirements for sealants and sealing. Also 
include detailed finish repair procedures and information regarding 
compatibility of sealants with base and finish coatings.
EIFS must be installed only by an applicator trained by the EIFS 
manufacturer. Specifically, include all manufacturer recommended 
provisions regarding flashing and treatment of wall penetrations. Any 
materials that show visual evidence of biological growth due to the 
presence of moisture must not be installed on the building project.
[3.3.1 Sheathing Board
Edges and ends of boards must be butted snugly with vertical joints 
staggered to provide full and even support for the insulation. Do not 
align sheathing board joints with wall openings. Provide support at both 
vertical and horizontal joints. Attach sheathing board [to metal studs 
with self-tapping drywall screws] [to concrete or masonry with corrosion 
resistant metal fasteners]. Place fasteners sufficiently close to support 
imposed loads, but not more than:
[ a. Maximum of 200 mm 8 inches apart on each supporting stud
][b. Maximum of 300 mm 12 inches apart horizontally and vertically into[ 
concrete][ masonry].
] Space fasteners more closely when required for negative wind load 
resistance.
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 23
]3.3.2 Insulation Board
Unless otherwise specified by the system manufacturer, place the long edge 
horizontally from level base line. Stagger vertical joints and interlock 
at corners. Butt joints tightly. Provide flush surfaces at joints. 
Offset insulation board joints from joints in sheathing by at least 200 mm
8 inches. Align drainage channels of integral drainage system or provide 
polypropylene drainage lath space to provide a path for any water weeped 
from behind the insulation to escape wall construction. Use L-shaped 
insulation board pieces at corners of openings. Joints of insulation must 
be butted tightly. Surfaces of adjacent insulation boards must be flush 
at joints. Gaps greater than 1.6 mm 1/16 inch between the insulation 
boards must be filled with slivers of insulation. Uneven board surfaces 
with irregularities projecting more than 1.6 mm 1/16 inch must be rasped 
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to produce an even 
surface. Attach insulation board as recommended by manufacturer. The 
adhered insulation board must be allowed to remain undisturbed for 24 
hours prior to proceeding with the installation of the base 
coat/reinforcing mesh, or longer if necessary for the adhesive to dry. 
However, do not leave insulation board exposed longer than recommended by 
insulation manufacturer.
**************************************************************************
NOTE: For PM systems, specify mechanical fastening 
of insulation board to the sheathing board. For PB 
systems mechanical attachment may be specified as an 
option.
**************************************************************************
[3.3.2.1 Mechanically Fastened Insulation Boards
Fasten with manufacturer's standard corrosion resistant anchors, spaced as 
recommended by manufacturer, but not more than 600 mm 2 feet horizontally 
and vertically.
][3.3.2.2 Adhesively Fastened Insulation Boards
Apply insulation board using adhesive spread with a notched trowel to the 
back of the insulation boards in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
]3.3.3 Base Coat and Reinforcing Fabric Mesh,
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Delete the inapplicable system (Class PM or 
Class PB EIFS).
**************************************************************************
[3.3.3.1 Class PB Systems
Allow the adhered insulation board to dry for 24 hours, or longer if 
necessary, prior to proceeding with the installation of the base 
coat/reinforcing fabric mesh. Install reinforcing fabric in accordance 
with manufacturer's instructions. Mix base coat in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions and apply to insulated wall surfaces to the 
thickness specified by the system manufacturer and provide any other 
reinforcement recommended by EIFS manufacturer. Trowel the reinforcing 
fabric mesh into the wet base coat material. Fully embed the mesh in the 
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 24
base coat. When properly worked-in, the pattern of the reinforcing fabric 
mesh must not be visible. Provide diagonal reinforcement at opening 
corners. Back-wrap or edge wrap all terminations of the EIFS. Overlap the 
reinforcing fabric mesh a minimum of 60 mm 2.5 inches on previously 
installed mesh, or butted, in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
][3.3.3.2 Class PM Systems
Mechanically fasten reinforcing fabric mesh to the insulated wall using 
the type and spacing of fasteners specified in the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Provide diagonal reinforcement at opening corners. Mix base 
coat in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Apply base coat in 
accordance with manufacturer's instruction to provide a complete, tight 
coating of uniform thickness as specified by the manufacturer. Cover all 
fiberglass reinforcing fabric, including at back wrapped areas at panel 
joints and at fasteners.
]3.3.4 Finish Coat
The base coat/reinforcing mesh must be allowed to dry a minimum of 24 
hours prior to application of the finish coat. Surface irregularities in 
the base coat, such as trowel marks, board lines, and reinforcing mesh 
laps, must be corrected prior to the application of the finish coat. 
Apply and level finish coat in one operation. Obtain final texture by 
trowels, floats, or by spray application as necessary to achieve the 
required finish matching approved [sample] [mock-up installation]. Apply 
the finish coat to the dry base coat maintaining a wet edge at all times 
to obtain a uniform appearance. The thickness of the finish coat must be 
in accordance with the system manufacturer’s current published 
instructions. Apply finish coat so that it does not cover surfaces to 
which joint sealants are to be applied. 
3.4 JOINT SEALING
Seal EIFS at openings as recommended by the system manufacturer. Apply 
sealant only to the base coat with EIFS Manufacturer's color coating. Do 
not apply sealant to the finish coat.
3.4.1 Surface Preparation, Backer Rod, and Primer
Immediately prior to application, remove loose matter from joint. Ensure 
that joint is dry and free of finish coat, or other foreign matter. 
Install backer rod. Apply primer as required by sealant and EIFS 
manufacturer. Check that joint width is as shown on drawings but in no 
case can it be less than 13 mm 0.5 inch for perimeter seals and 20 mm 0.75 
inch for expansion joints. The width must not be less than 4 times the 
anticipated movement. Check sealant manufacturer's recommendations 
regarding proper width to depth ratio.
3.4.2 Sealant
Do not apply sealant until all EIFS coatings are fully dry. Apply sealant 
in accordance with sealant manufacturer's instructions with gun having 
nozzle that fits joint width. Do not use sealant that has exceeded shelf 
life or cannot be discharged in a continuous flow. Completely fill the 
joint solidly with sealant without air pockets so that full contact is 
made with both sides of the joint. Tool sealant with a round instrument 
that provides a concave profile and a uniformly smooth and wrinkle free 
SECTION 07 24 00 Page 25
sealant surface. Do not wet tool the joint with soap, water, or any other 
liquid tooling aid. During inclement weather, protect the joints until 
sealant application. Use particular caution in sealing joints between 
window and door frames and the EIFS wall and at all other wall 
penetrations. Clean all surfaces to remove excess sealant.
3.5 FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
**************************************************************************
NOTE: EIFS is applied in layers where installation 
deficiencies can be hidden with the application of 
subsequent layers. Include in Section 01 45 00
QUALITY CONTROL, inspection requirements appropriate 
to the size and significance of the project. For 
all but minor projects, require a full-time on-site 
inspector during the installation of EIFS and its 
sealing. The inspector should have at least 2 years 
experience in the installation of the particular 
manufacturer's EIFS being installed and a total of 
not less than 3 years of EIFS inspection experience. 
Some EIFS manufacturers provide field inspection 
services during installation. Identify the EIFS 
inspector as a QC Specialist in Section 01 45 00
QUALITY CONTROL. For all but small jobs, the EIFS 
inspector should have no other duties than those of 
inspecting the installation. For major projects 
requiring a third-party inspector, include paragraph 
THIRD-PARTY INSPECTION below.
**************************************************************************
Throughout the installation, the Contractor must establish and maintain an 
inspection procedure to assure compliance of the installed EIFS with 
Contract requirements. Work not in compliance must be removed and 
replaced or corrected in an approved manner. The inspection procedures, 
from acceptance of deliveries through installation of sealants and final 
acceptance must be performed by a qualified inspector trained by the 
manufacturer. No work on the EIFS is allowed unless the inspector is 
present at the job site.
[3.5.1 Third-Party Inspection
Provide full-time third-party inspection during the entire process of 
installing the EIFS, from examination through cleanup. The third-party 
inspector must be certified by the Exterior Design Institute (EDI), AWCI, 
or by an equivalent independent party and must be trained in the proper 
installation of EIFS.
]3.5.2 Inspection Checklist
During the installation and at the completion of installation, perform 
inspections covering at the minimum all applicable items enumerated on the 
attached checklist. The inspector must initial and date all applicable

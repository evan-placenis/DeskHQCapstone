      1. **ANALYZE:** Look at the visual evidence provided above.
      2. **SEARCH:** You may search for specifications in internal knowledge or helpful information on the web. If you have already called it, you should proceed to 'writeSection' to write about your findings if they are relevant.
        - **MAXIMUM SEARCH LIMIT:** You are strictly limited to a maximum of TWO (2) searches for this task. 
        - **FALLBACK:** If you cannot find the required weather, crew, or site data after 2 searches, STOP searching immediately. You MUST proceed to 'writeSection' and use the exact **[MISSING: <Data Type>]** placeholders for any unknown information. Do not make up any information.
        3. **WRITE:** Write the section "SITE / STAGING AREA", use the 'writeSection' tool to save your work.
        - **CRITICAL:** Every technical observation must site a spec if possible. Use the exact document name provided (e.g. "as per the Concrete_Specs_2024 document" or "per specification Concrete_Specs_2024").
      
      **CRITICAL:** When calling writeSection, you MUST use reportId: "dce22aa2-5518-4fe3-9661-7f6e6e89e150". Do not use any other ID.
      **ALLOWED TOOLS ONLY:** You have writeSection and research tools (e.g. searchInternalKnowledge for specifications). There is NO finishReport, submit_report, or completeReport tool. When the section is saved via writeSection, stop; the system will advance to the next task automatically.

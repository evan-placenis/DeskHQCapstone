[MESSAGE 1] Role: AI --------------------------------

<thinking>
I am tasked with writing the **DEFICIENCY SUMMARY** section of a structural/envelope inspection report. 

The input data provided for the findings (Site/Staging, Observations, EIFS Progress, Wall Penetrations) contains only the placeholder "Section saved." and no actual descriptive text of the deficiencies observed on site. 

Following the **MISSING INFORMATION PROTOCOL**, I must not guess or invent specific deficiencies. Instead, I must use the `**[MISSING: <Data Type>]**` format to highlight where the human engineer needs to insert the specific findings. 

I will structure the summary based on the trades identified in the input (Division 07 - EIFS and Wall Penetrations). I will use the required phrasing: "Contractor to rectify [Issue] in accordance with Specification [Ref]." 

I will also include a placeholder for "Critical/Safety Issues" as per the reporting protocols, even though none were explicitly listed, to ensure the Senior Principal Engineer can flag them if necessary.

I will perform a brief search to identify standard specification references for EIFS and Wall Penetrations to ensure the placeholders are as professional and accurate as possible for the human reviewer.

      1. **ANALYZE:** Look at the visual evidence provided above.
      2. **SEARCH:** You may search for specifications in internal knowledge or helpful information on the web. If you have already called it, you should proceed to 'writeSection' to write about your findings if they are relevant.
        - **MAXIMUM SEARCH LIMIT:** You are strictly limited to a maximum of TWO (2) searches for this task. 
        - **FALLBACK:** If you cannot find the required weather, crew, or site data after 2 searches, STOP searching immediately. You MUST proceed to 'writeSection' and use the exact **[MISSING: <Data Type>]** placeholders for any unknown information. Do not make up any information.
        3. **WRITE:** Write the section "SITE / STAGING AREA", use the 'writeSection' tool to save your work.
        - **CRITICAL:** Every technical observation must site a spec if possible. Use the exact document name provided (e.g. "as per the Concrete_Specs_2024 document" or "per specification Concrete_Specs_2024").
      
      **CRITICAL:** When calling writeSection, you MUST use reportId: "798e34bb-521a-4a84-8d60-49b0b67826e0". Do not use any other ID.
      **ALLOWED TOOLS ONLY:** You have writeSection and research tools (e.g. searchInternalKnowledge for specifications). There is NO finishReport, submit_report, or completeReport tool. When the section is saved via writeSection, stop; the system will advance to the next task automatically.

4. Joint layout on elevations. The designer must 
locate joint spacing and areas within the 
recommendations of at least three qualified EIFS 
manufacturers. Show all expansion joints at 
building expansion joints, where substrates change, 
and where significant structural movement occurs.

help prevent lamina cracking. Individual areas must 
not exceed 14 square meters 150 square feet, with a 
maximum dimension not exceeding 5500 mm 18 feet and 
a maximum length to height ratio of 2.5 to 1.0.

ASTM E2098/E2098M and as recommended by EIFS manufacturer.
2.10 FINISH COAT
Manufacturer's standard product conforming to the requirements in the 
paragraph on Sub-Component Requirements and Tests. For color consistency, 
use materials from the same batch or lot number.
2.11 SEALANT PRIMER
Non-staining, quick-drying type recommended by sealant manufacturer and 
EIFS manufacturer.
2.12 ACCESSORIES
Conform to recommendations of EIFS manufacturer, including trim, edging, 
anchors, and expansion joints. All metal items and fasteners to be

absorptive materials as backer rod. Size the backer rod 25 percent larger 
than the width of the joint.
PART 3 EXECUTION
3.1 EXAMINATION
Examine substrate and existing conditions to determine that the EIFS can 
be installed as required by the EIFS manufacturer and that all work 
related to the EIFS is properly coordinated. Surface must be sound and 
free of oil, loose materials or protrusions which will interfere with the 
system installation. If deficiencies are found, notify the Contracting 
Officer and do not proceed with installation until the deficiencies are 
corrected. The substrate must be plane, with no deviation greater than 6 mm
 1/4 inch when tested with a 3 m 10 foot straightedge. Determine 
flatness, plumbness, and any other conditions for conformance to 
manufacturer's instructions.

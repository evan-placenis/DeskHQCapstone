      1. **ANALYZE:** Look at the visual evidence provided above.
      2. **SEARCH:** You may search for specifications in internal knowledge or helpful information on the web. If you have already called it, you should proceed to 'writeSection' to write about your findings if they are relevant.
        - **MAXIMUM SEARCH LIMIT:** You are strictly limited to a maximum of TWO (2) searches for this task. 
        - **FALLBACK:** If you cannot find the required weather, crew, or site data after 2 searches, STOP searching immediately. You MUST proceed to 'writeSection' and use the exact **[MISSING: <Data Type>]** placeholders for any unknown information. Do not make up any information.
        3. **WRITE:** Write the section "SITE / STAGING AREA", use the 'writeSection' tool to save your work.
        - **CRITICAL:** Every technical observation must site a spec if possible. Use the exact document name provided (e.g. "as per the Concrete_Specs_2024 document" or "per specification Concrete_Specs_2024").
      
      **CRITICAL:** When calling writeSection, you MUST use reportId: "798e34bb-521a-4a84-8d60-49b0b67826e0". Do not use any other ID.
      **ALLOWED TOOLS ONLY:** You have writeSection and research tools (e.g. searchInternalKnowledge for specifications). There is NO finishReport, submit_report, or completeReport tool. When the section is saved via writeSection, stop; the system will advance to the next task automatically.

Manufacturer's standard product conforming to the requirements in the 
paragraph on Sub-Component Requirements and Tests. For color consistency, 
use materials from the same batch or lot number.
2.11 SEALANT PRIMER

PART 3 EXECUTION
3.1 EXAMINATION
Examine substrate and existing conditions to determine that the EIFS can 
be installed as required by the EIFS manufacturer and that all work 
related to the EIFS is properly coordinated. Surface must be sound and 
free of oil, loose materials or protrusions which will interfere with the 
system installation. If deficiencies are found, notify the Contracting 
Officer and do not proceed with installation until the deficiencies are 
corrected. The substrate must be plane, with no deviation greater than 6 mm
 1/4 inch when tested with a 3 m 10 foot straightedge. Determine 
flatness, plumbness, and any other conditions for conformance to 
manufacturer's instructions.

      2. **SEARCH:** You may search for specifications in internal knowledge or helpful information on the web. If you have already called it, you should proceed to 'writeSection' to write about your findings if they are relevant.
        - **MAXIMUM SEARCH LIMIT:** You are strictly limited to a maximum of TWO (2) searches for this task. 
        - **FALLBACK:** If you cannot find the required weather, crew, or site data after 2 searches, STOP searching immediately. You MUST proceed to 'writeSection' and use the exact **[MISSING: <Data Type>]** placeholders for any unknown information. Do not make up any information.
        3. **WRITE:** Write the section "Division 07 - Thermal and Moisture Protection: Wall Penetrations", use the 'writeSection' tool to save your work.
        - **CRITICAL:** Every technical observation must site a spec if possible. Use the exact document name provided (e.g. "as per the Concrete_Specs_2024 document" or "per specification Concrete_Specs_2024").
      
      **CRITICAL:** When calling writeSection, you MUST use reportId: "798e34bb-521a-4a84-8d60-49b0b67826e0". Do not use any other ID.
      **ALLOWED TOOLS ONLY:** You have writeSection and research tools (e.g. searchInternalKnowledge for specifications). There is NO finishReport, submit_report, or completeReport tool. When the section is saved via writeSection, stop; the system will advance to the next task automatically.

d, base the required pressure on wind 
speed specified in ICC IBC. Higher values may be 
used as required by applicable building code or 
based on local experience of wind forces at the 
site. Conduct tests both for positive and negative 
pressure.
Design must meet the requirements of UFC 3-101-01 
Architecture. UFC 3-101-01 provides references to 
ASHRAE 90.1 and IgCC regarding energy efficiency and 
thermal properties related to the building envelope 
design including moisture control and thermal

performance.
**************************************************************************
The system must meet the performance requirements as verified by the tests 
listed below. Where a wall system of similar type, size, and design as 
specified for this project has been previously tested under the condition 
specified herein, the resulting test reports may be submitted in lieu of 
job specific tests.
1.2.1.1 Water Penetration
Test the system for water penetration by uniform static air pressure in 
accordance with ASTM E331. There must be no penetration of water beyond 
the plane of the base coat/EPS board interface after 15 minutes at 300 Pa
6.4 psf, or 20 percent of positive design wind pressure, whichever is 
greater.
1.2.1.2 Wind Load Test
Test the system for wind load by uniform static air pressure in accordance 
with ASTM E330/E330M (procedure A) to a minimum pressure of [_____] Pa
[_____] psf. There must be no permanent deformation, delamination, or 
other deterioration.
1.2.1.3 Full Scale or Intermediate Scale Fire Test
Conduct wall fire test using apparatus, specimen, performance criteria, 
and procedure in accordance with NFPA 285 when required by ICC IBC
2603.5.5. The following requirements must be met:
a. No vertical spread of flame within core of panel from one story to the 
next.
b. No flame spread over the exterior surface.
c. No vertical flame spread over the interior surface from one story to 
the next.
d. No significant lateral

must 
exhibit no cracking, checking, or splitting, and negligible weight gain. 
Class PM systems must be tested in accordance with ASTM C67/C67M for 50 
cycles of freezing and thawing. After testing, the specimens must exhibit 
no cracking or checking and have negligible weight gain.
1.2.3.7 Sample Boards
Unless otherwise stated, provide sample EIFS Component 300 by 600 mm 12 by 
24 inches, on sheathing board, including finish color and texture, typical 
joints and sealant. If more than one color, finish, or pattern is used, 
provide one sample for each. The test specimen must consist of 
reinforcing mesh, base coat, and finish coat applied in accordance with 
manufacturer's printed recommendations to the insulation board to be used 
on the building.
1.2.4 Moisture Analysis
**************************************************************************
NOTE: Condensation of water vapor within the system 
or wall assembly can lead to performance problems. 
Condensation can cause leaks in the wall leading to 
damage to the wall structure such as rotting of wood 
studs, corrosion of metal framing, mold, staining 
and discoloration of interior finishes. Moisture, 
if trapped in EIFS, expands upon freezing, and it

can damage the EIFS coatings. Should analysis 
determine that the project design is potentially 
subject to condensation or mold problems, the 
installation of a vapor retarder, changing the 
insulation thickness, or selecting a different 
insulation material may be required.
Design to meet the requirements of UFC 1-200-02, 
High Performance and Sustainable Building 
Requirements, and UFC 3-101-01, Architecture.
For additional guidance see ASHRAE Handbook of 
Fundamentals, Chapters 25-27 Heat, Air and Moisture 
Control in Building Assemblies - Fundamentals, and 
ASTM C755, Standard Practice for Selection of Water 
Vapor Retarders for Thermal Insulation. The 
computer program MOIST is a user-friendly tool based 
on hourly weather data that

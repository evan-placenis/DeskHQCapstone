# GENERAL

A site review was conducted at **[MISSING: Specific Floor/Elevation/Gridline]** to evaluate the progress and conformance of the building envelope assembly, focusing on Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS) and Air Barrier/Waterproofing installations. 

**Key Findings and Deficiencies:**
*   **EIFS Corner Reinforcement (Spec 07 24 00):** The Contractor was reminded to ensure that all diagonal mesh strips are correctly installed at window and door corners prior to the application of the base coat. Proper reinforcement at these high-stress locations is critical to prevent premature cracking.
*   **Air Barrier Continuity (Spec 07 27 00):** Installation of Blueskin SA membrane was observed at the building's top transition, where it is being integrated with existing metal flashing over wood blocking. While the application is underway, the Contractor is responsible for ensuring the membrane maintains a continuous, airtight seal at all transitions.

**Project Progress:**
Building envelope work is currently focused on air barrier transitions and the preparation of EIFS substrates. Work progress relative to the project schedule appears to be **[MISSING: Schedule Status]**.

*Note: This general review is limited to the specific areas and components observed during the site visit and does not relieve the Contractor of their sole responsibility for construction execution, safety, and full compliance with the Contract Documents and applicable building codes.*

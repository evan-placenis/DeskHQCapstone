At window and door corners, the diagonally placed mesh must be at least 225mm x 300mm (9”x12”). The Contractor is reminded to ensure these \"butterfly\" strips are correctly embedded in the base coat to prevent cracking at high-stress points.\n*   **Mesh Overlap:** Reinforcing mesh was observed being embedded into the wet base coat. Per specification **07 24 00**, a minimum overlap of 100mm (4”) is required both vertically and horizontally. At interior and exterior corners, the mesh must be double-wrapped with an overlap of at least 300mm (12”) on each side, or a dedicated corner mesh must be used.\n*   **Insulation Exposure:** The Contractor is reminded that EPS insulation shall not be left exposed for more than 14 days without being covered by the base coat and reinforcing mesh, as per **07 24 00 - Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)**. Any insulation showing signs of UV degradation or weathering must be rasped or repaired prior to base coat application.\n*   **Base Coat Thickness:** Base coat application at joints intended to receive sealants must maintain a minimum dry thickness of 3.0mm (1/8”) +/- 0.5mm to ensure proper performance and substrate protection.\n*   **Impact Resistance:** Per the project specifications, High Impact Mesh (minimum 523 g/m²) is required at the bottom two floors and at all balcony locations. This must be installed prior to the application of the standard 200 g/m² mesh.\n\n| | |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **[MISSING: Description of observation for photo]** | ![Photo Placeholder](**[MISSING: Photo UUID]**) |\n",

      1. **ANALYZE:** Look at the visual evidence provided above.
      2. **SEARCH:** You may search for specifications in internal knowledge or helpful information on the web. If you have already called it, you should proceed to 'writeSection' to write about your findings if they are relevant.
        - **MAXIMUM SEARCH LIMIT:** You are strictly limited to a maximum of TWO (2) searches for this task. 
        - **FALLBACK:** If you cannot find the required weather, crew, or site data after 2 searches, STOP searching immediately. You MUST proceed to 'writeSection' and use the exact **[MISSING: <Data Type>]** placeholders for any unknown information. Do not make up any information.
        3. **WRITE:** Write the section "Site / Staging Area", use the 'writeSection' tool to save your work.
        - **CRITICAL:** Every technical observation must site a spec if possible. Use the exact document name provided (e.g. "as per the Concrete_Specs_2024 document" or "per specification Concrete_Specs_2024").
      
      **CRITICAL:** When calling writeSection, you MUST use reportId: "12dc556a-bc7b-47fb-88c5-0328a0e6242b". Do not use any other ID.
      **ALLOWED TOOLS ONLY:** You have writeSection and research tools (e.g. searchInternalKnowledge for specifications). There is NO finishReport, submit_report, or completeReport tool. When the section is saved via writeSection, stop; the system will advance to the next task automatically.

Section: PRODUCTS > Standard Mesh: Minimum 200 g/m² (6.0 oz/yd²)

High Impact Mesh at Bottom Two Floors and at Balconies: Minimum 523 g/m² (15.0 oz/yd²) followed by 200 g/m² (6.0 oz) Standard Mesh
Corner Mesh:   A 7.2 oz/yd² (244 g/m²) followed by standard mesh.
Use of “adhesive mesh” is not acceptable unless it is used with manufacturer approved pre-wrapped starter boards that include reveals to secure the base coat to the insulation (i.e., Pre-wrapped EPS Starters by Extrusion or approved equivalent), or it is applied over base coat. This applies to ornate moulding or trim profiles only which are applied over reinforced EIFS base coat.
Finish Coat Primer (Compliant with CAN/ULC 716.1):
As recommended by the EIFS Manufacturer, colour-tinted, pigmented acrylic primer to match finish coat colour. Acceptable materials:

Section: EXECUTION > Base Coat and Reinforcing Mesh (Part 1)

EPS insulation shall not be left exposed for more than 14 days without covering by the base coat and reinforcing mesh.
Inspect the insulation for damage and deterioration due to weathering, and repair prior to application of base coat.
Apply base coat at the minimum wet thickness specified by the EIFS manufacturer. Note: The minimum dry thickness of the base coat is contingent upon the fire tested assembly of the EIFS manufacturer’s proprietary system. Two (2) passes of the base coat are required to achieve the minimum dry thickness. It may be greater than 1.6mm (1/16”) to comply with Code. Joints to receive sealants are to have a minimum dry thickness of 3.0mm (⅛”) +/- 0.5mm.
Immediately embed reinforcing mesh into the wet base coat. The reinforcing mesh colour shall not be visible through the base coat. The reinforcing mesh pattern may be slightly visible. Overlap the reinforcing mesh a minimum of 100mm (4”) both vertically and horizontally as it is being embedded into the base coat. Note: The minimum overlap of the reinforcing mesh is contingent upon the fire tested assembly of the EIFS manufacturer’s proprietary system. It may be greater than 100mm (4”) to comply with Code.
Reinforcing mesh at interior and exterior corners shall be double wrapped, overlapping the mesh at least 300mm (12”) on each side of the corner. Corner reinforcing mesh can be installed in lieu of double wrapping the standard weight of reinforcing mesh.
Reinforcing mesh shall be applied at a 45 o at the corners of all through wall penetrations. At the corners of windows, doors, and penetrations greater than 300mm x 300mm (12”x12”), the diagonally placed mesh shall be at least 225mm x 300mm (9”x12”), lengthwise in tangent to the corner.

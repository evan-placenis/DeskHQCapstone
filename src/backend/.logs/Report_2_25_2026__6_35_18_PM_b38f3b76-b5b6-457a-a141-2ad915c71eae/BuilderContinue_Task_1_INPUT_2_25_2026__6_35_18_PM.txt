No specific photos assigned to this section. Rely on general context or internal knowledge.

    
--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
    1. **ANALYZE:** Look at the visual evidence provided above.
    2. **SEARCH:** You may search for specifications in internal knowledge or helpful information on the web. If you have already called it, you should proceed to 'writeSection' to write about your findings if they are relevant.
       - **CRITICAL SEARCH RULE:** Do NOT include the Report ID (e.g., UUIDs) or words like "report" in your search query. Use only pure technical keywords (e.g., "EIFS window flashing details").
       3. **WRITE:** Write the section "# SITE / STAGING AREA", use the 'writeSection' tool to save your work.
      - **CRITICAL:** Every technical observation must site a spec if possible. Use the exact document name provided (e.g. "as per the Concrete_Specs_2024 document" or "per specification Concrete_Specs_2024").
    
    **CRITICAL:** When calling writeSection, you MUST use reportId: "b38f3b76-b5b6-457a-a141-2ad915c71eae". Do not use any other ID.
    **ALLOWED TOOLS ONLY:** You have writeSection and research tools (e.g. searchInternalKnowledge for specifications). There is NO finishReport, submit_report, or completeReport tool. When the section is saved via writeSection, stop; the system will advance to the next task automatically.

Section: GENERAL > Environmental Requirements

Perform work only during weather conditions acceptable to the systems manufacturer. As a minimum, do not apply materials when the ambient and surface temperatures are below 4°C, or above 35°C. Temperatures shall remain above 4°C for at least 24 hours after application, or until the materials have cured/dried.
Weather conditions affect application and drying/curing time. Hot or dry conditions limit working time and accelerate drying/curing and may require adjustments in the scheduling of work to achieve desired results; cool or damp conditions extend working time and retard drying/curing, and may require added measures of protection against wind, dust, dirt, rain and freezing.
The Contractor is responsible to provide adequate protection of the materials during the wet or uncured state, including but not limited to wind, dust, dirt, rain and freezing.
Provide temporary enclosures and controlled heat to the work area if required. If enclosures are used, care must be taken to ensure that elevated moisture and temperature conditions do not adversely affect the materials. Note: Once the insulation is installed the adhesive will be insulated from the exterior, and may drop below 4°C despite exterior temporary heating. In these situations, the interior temperature of the facility must also be maintained above 4°C. Once EIFS materials have dried, no heating is required during construction.
Provide protection of surrounding areas and adjacent surfaces from application of materials.
Maintain a weather log to be kept on site on days where work is being performed.

Section: Introduction

existing conditions and objectives
The building is 10 stories in height and was constructed circa 1970. The building footprint is approximately 880m 2 (9,470 ft 2 ) and there are 100 units. There is no underground parking garage below the building.
There are 54 cantilevered balcony slabs (arranged in six (6) risers) constructed of conventionally reinforced cast-in-place concrete. All balconies support prefinished aluminum guards.
The exterior walls consist of through-the-wall (TTW) brick masonry with rigid insulation and a plaster finish at the interior. The masonry at the top six (6) floors is overclad with metal siding. The masonry is supported exposed concrete floor slabs that are recessed back from the face of the brick. The aluminum-framed punched windows that were installed circa 2007 and the parapet cap flashing was installed with the recent roof replacement project.
This project includes removal of the existing metal cladding and retrofitting the building with a combination of Exterior Insulation Finish System (EIFS) and Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) cladding. Also included in the scope of work is replacement of the window and balcony door assemblies, painting of balcony soffits and slab edges to coordinate with the new building colour scheme, and canopy repairs and waterproofing.
The project is intended to commence in April 2025, with all work completed during the 2025 construction season.

soon as possible.
Provide temporary barriers to restrict operation of balcony doors when work is performed at or adjacent to the balconies. Fastening to the new window or door frames is not permitted.
Prior to commencement of the Work, record condition and take photographs of existing building and landscaping components. Provide daily and final cleanup to restore building and site landscaping (grassed areas, shrubs and hard surfaces) to pre-construction conditions. During the completion of the Work, every attempt to minimize damage to landscaping shall be exercised, including the control of debris.
For work completed by a subcontractor, a representative of the general contractor must be present on site at all times.
Project is to be completed in 2025. It is expected that work will start in early spring as soon weather permits.
Bonding (Item 1.2): Obtain bonding as set out in the specifications. This item may be removed from the Tender Form at the option of the Owner.
EIFS Mock-Up (Item 1.3): Install a full EIFS mock-up in
